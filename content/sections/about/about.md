I first got my feet wet in software development during my undergraduate studies in Systems Engineering at the US Naval Academy from 2011-2015. After leaving the Navy in 2017 and spending several years doing a fairly uninteresting job not related to my degree, I decided to refresh my software development skills with [Springboard](https://www.springboard.com) and get started on a new career in a field in which I'm far more interested.

I've been doing freelance web development with Microsoft Azure since November 2020, taking on projects from building databases with web scrapers, to hosting podcasts with RSS feeds, to building web sites for small businesses.

When I'm not developing software, you can find me reading classical literature and philosophy, lifting heavy barbells, playing chess, or writing and thinking about all manner of things.
