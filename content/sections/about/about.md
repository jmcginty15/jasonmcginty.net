I first got my feet wet in software development during my undergraduate studies in Systems Engineering at the US Naval Academy from 2011-2015. After leaving the Navy in 2017 and spending several years doing a fairly uninteresting job not related to my degree, I decided to refresh my software development skills with [Springboard](https://www.springboard.com) and get started on a new career in a field in which I'm far more interested.

The photo is from a three-week mountaineering trip in the mountains of central Alaska with the [National Outdoor Leadership School](https://www.nols.edu/en/) in 2013. You'll have to forgive the potato quality, but it was taken on a mountain after all.

When I'm not developing software, you can find me reading classical literature and philosophy, lifting heavy barbells, playing chess, or writing and thinking about all manner of things.
