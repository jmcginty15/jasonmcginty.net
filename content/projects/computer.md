An ongoing project where I build a computer from scratch, from Nand gates up to an operating system, following the procedure outlined in [The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686) by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken.

Current stage: Chapter 12 - Operating System
