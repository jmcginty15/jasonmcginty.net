Browser application built to realistically depict the motions of the planets and moons of our solar system. Queries [NASA's JPL Horizons database](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons) for real positions and velocities of solar system bodies at a selected date and time, then uses Newtonian physics to simulate motions of the bodies in space.
