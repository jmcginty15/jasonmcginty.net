— *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* (2003)

We all remember the death of the Witch-king of Angmar, the leader of Sauron's Nazgûl, from the 2003 conclusion to Peter Jackson's film trilogy. In the movie it's mostly just a girl power moment and one of the major turning points of the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. It's not a bad scene, and the scene itself does adapt the same scene from the book pretty accurately, but this scene is one of the best examples I've found of the movies just not being in the same league as the books in the department of lore, world-building, symbolism, and the depth of philosophy that flows out of those things.

To see why, we have to go back. All the way back to the Second Age, in fact, almost 5000 years before the events of *The Lord of the Rings*.

### The Nazgûl, the Witch-king, the Battle of Fornost, and Glorfindel's Prophecy

> *Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,*\
>  &emsp;*Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,*\
> *Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,*\
>  &emsp;*One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne*\
> *In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.*\
>  &emsp;*One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,*\
>  &emsp;*One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them*\
> *In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.*

— *The Fellowship of the Ring*, Book One, Chapter II: The Shadow of the Past

Sauron forges the One Ring around the year 1600 of the Second Age and attempts to use it to bring the bearers of the other Rings of Power under his direct control. The Elven-rings are hidden from his influence, having been forged only by the Elf-smith Celebrimbor rather than by Sauron himself. The Dwarf-lords to whom the Seven were given prove too resilient for Sauron to control directly due to their natural Dwarven stubbornness and strength. Of these rings, four are destroyed and three are eventually lost and recovered by Sauron.

*(I must try to stay on track and not get off on 1,582 tangents about Middle-earth lore.)*

The Mortal Men to whom the Nine were given suffer a different fate. Great kings of Men, their Rings initially grant them unnatural powers and extend their lives seemingly indefinitely, enabling them to gain even more power and wealth. One by one, they all succumb to the power of the One Ring, becoming permanently invisible and losing their own wills completely. When the process is complete, they are the Nazgûl, or Ringwraiths, fully under the domination of Sauron's will and acting as mere extensions of Sauron himself.

The Nazgûl disappear from Middle-earth for a while after the defeat of Sauron at the end of the Second Age, but reappear with the resurgence of Sauron around the year 1300 of the Third Age. Shortly after this time, the mightiest of the Nine establishes himself as king in the northern realm of Angmar and sets to work destroying neighboring Arnor, one of the two kingdoms established in Middle-earth by the remnants of the Númenóreans after Númenor was destroyed near the end of the Second Age.

The Witch-king succeeds in destroying Arnor as a kingdom after several hundred years of intermittent war. The people survive as a remnant, which goes on to become the Rangers of the north of which Aragorn is one, guarding the borders of the Shire from unseen terrors. An army from Gondor, the other Númenórean kingdom, arrives to the war too late to save their kindred from destruction, but marches against Angmar with vengeance in mind anyway, allied with an Elven army from Lindon.

All of this culminates in a battle near the city of Fornost, where the armies of Angmar are finally smashed. As the Witch-king flees the destruction, Eärnur, crown prince of Gondor and leader of the Gondorian forces, tries to pursue him but is stopped by the Elf Glorfindel, who says:

> Do not pursue him! He will not return to this land. Far off yet is his doom, and not by the hand of man will he fall.

— Appendix A: Annals of the Kings and Rulers, I: The Númenorean Kings, iv: Gondor and the Heirs of Anárion

Glorfindel probably deserves some discussion of his own backstory, but for now suffice it to say that he is killed fighting a Balrog during the First Age but is resurrected and sent back to Middle-earth by the Valar around the same time Sauron forges the One Ring during the Second Age. He is not present at all in the films, but his statement about the Witch-king at the Battle of Fornost turns out to be a multilayered prophecy.

The Witch-king's reign in Angmar is ended at the Battle of Fornost, but he escapes back to the south to continue serving Sauron, ultimately destined to die at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. There, he meets his doom when he crosses paths with two other important characters, one of whom just happens to be armed with an abnormally powerful weapon.

### The Barrow-blades and Chance Happenings

In an episode that was famously (among nerds like me, at least) left out of the films completely, Frodo's band of merry Hobbits takes a detour through the Old Forest on their way out of the Shire, near the very beginning of their quest. There they meet the enigmatic Tom Bombadil and his companion Goldberry before setting out again through a region called Tyrn Gorthad, also known as the Barrow-downs, a region filled with graves of Men killed in the ancient war with Angmar we've just been talking about.

> At Fornost upon the North Downs also the Númenóreans dwelt, and in Cardolan, and in the hills of Rhudaur; and towers they raised upon Emyn Beraid and upon Amon Sûl; and there remain many barrows and ruined works in those places, but the towers of Emyn Beraid still look towards the sea.

— *The Silmarillion*, Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age

As is the case with many dark places in Middle-earth, these graves are now inhabited by dark things, in this case Barrow-wights, evil spirits that may have even been sent there by the Witch-king himself. The Hobbits are snared by one of these wights and nearly killed, but Bombadil, like the absolute Chad that he is, rescues them in the nick of time with one of his catchy tunes. This seemingly minor little mishap during a detour in fact turns out to rank right up there with the most important events to ever happen in the Third Age.

Many of the Men buried in the graves on the Barrow-downs were buried with the weapons and gear they used in life, and the grave the Hobbits fall into is no exception. After his rescue, Tom picks the Hobbits out some items useful for the journey ahead. You'll have to indulge me a bit of a longer quotation now, since this one is pretty important.

> For each of the hobbits he chose a dagger, long, leaf-shaped, and keen, of marvellous workmanship, damasked with serpent-forms in red and gold. They gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths, wrought of some strange metal, light and strong, and set with many fiery stones. Whether by some virtue in these sheaths or because of the spell that lay on the mound, the blades seemed untouched by time, unrusted, sharp, glittering in the sun.
>
> 'Old knives are long enough as swords for hobbit-people,' he said. 'Sharp blades are good to have, if Shire-folk go walking, east, south, or far away into dark and danger.' Then he told them that these blades were forged many long years ago by Men of Westernesse: they were foes of the Dark Lord, but they were overcome by the evil king of Carn Dûm in the Land of Angmar.
>
> 'Few now remember them,' Tom murmured, 'yet still some go wandering, sons of forgotted kings walking in loneliness, guarding from evil things folk that are heedless.'
>
> The hobbits did not understand his words, but as he spoke they had a vision as it were of a great expanse of years behind them, like a vast shadowy plain over which there strode shapes of Men, tall and grim with bright swords, and last came one with a star on his brow. Then the vision faded, and they were back in the sunlit world. It was time to start again. They made ready, packing their bags and lading their ponies. Their new weapons they hung on their leather belts under their jackets, feeling them very awkward, and wondering if they would be of any use. Fighting had not before occurred to any of them as one of the adventures in which their flight would land them.

— *The Fellowship of the Ring*, Book One, Chapter VIII: Fog on the Barrow-downs

The Hobbits are granted a brief glimpse into the ancient history of their region, a region thoroughly steeped in deep lore about which they mostly have no idea. The Hobbits are innocent. This is their first time ever stepping foot outside the Shire, and they have already encountered grave peril. They may never come to fully appreciate the significance of chance events such as their fall into the barrow, except in brief and fleeting glimpses. Events such as this are always significant (we'll see shortly why this particular event is significant), but whether they truly happen by chance is another matter.

Samwise Gamgee is granted another of these fleeting glimpses into the true nature of the world much later, near the end of his quest. During his journey with Frodo across the wastes of Mordor, he stays up one night keeping watch as Frodo sleeps.

> Frodo sighed and was asleep almost before the words were spoken. Sam struggled with his own weariness, and he took Frodo's hand; and there he sat silent till deep night fell. Then at last, to keep himself awake, he crawled from the hiding-place and looked out. The land seemed full of creaking and cracking and sly noises, but there was no sound of voice or of foot. Far above the Ephel Dúath in the West the night-sky was still dim and pale. There, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tor high up in the mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him. For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach. His song in the Tower had been defiance rather than hope; for then he was thinking of himself. Now, for a moment, his own fate, and even his master's, ceased to trouble him. He crawled back into the brambles and laid himself by Frodo's side, and putting away all fear he cast himself into a deep untroubled sleep.

In a scene ultimately cut from Tolkien's final draft of *The Lord of the Rings*, Gandalf converses with Frodo, Merry, Pippin, and Gimli in a house in Minas Tirith shortly after the final defeat of Sauron and the crowning of Aragorn as king of Gondor and Arnor. Gandalf tells the story of the beginnings of the quest to defeat the dragon Smaug and how he persuaded Thorin Oakenshield to take Bilbo Baggins on the journey. He tells of a series of seemingly chance events that led to the fulfillment of this quest, and sums up the point nicely at the end of his story, speaking of the overall outcome of the War of the Ring:

> 'It might all have gone very differently indeed. The main attack was diverted southwards, it is true; and yet even so with his far-stretched right hand Sauron could have done terrible harm in the North, while we defended Gondor, if King Brand and King Dáin had not stood in his path. When you think of the great Battle of Pelennor, do not forget the Battle of Dale. Think of what might have been. Dragon-fire and savage swords in Eriador! There might be no Queen in Gondor. We might now only hope to return from the victory here to ruin and ash. But that has been averted — because I met Thorin Oakenshield one evening on the edge of spring not far from Bree. A chance-meeting, as we say in Middle-earth.'

— *Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth*, Part Three: The Third Age, III: The Quest of Erebor

> And still Meriadoc the hobbit stood there blinking through his tears, and no one spoke to him, indeed none seemed to heed him. He brushed away the tears, and stooped to pick up the green shield that Éowyn had given him, and he slung it at his back. Then he looked for his sword that he had let fall; for even as he struck his blow his arm was numbed, and now he could only use his left hand. And behold! there lay his weapon, but the blade was smoking like a dry branch that has been thrust in a fire; and as he watched it, it writhed and withered and was consumed.
>
> So passed the sword of the Barrow-downs, work of Westernesse. But glad would he have been to know its fate who wrought it slowly long ago in the North-kingdom when the Dúnedain were young, and chief among their foes was the dread realm of Angmar and its sorcerer king. No other blade, not though mightier hands had wielded it, would have dealt that foe a wound so bitter, cleaving the undead flesh, breaking the spell that knit his unseen sinews to his will.
