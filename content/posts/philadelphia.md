In the spring of last year shortly before the apocalypse started, I decided I was fed up enough with my current job to start pursuing something new. There wasn't anything *wrong* with the job exactly; it had decent pay, good benefits, and good job security and was a fairly easygoing office job. It was just that I was bored out of my mind, didn't care about the work, and didn't see a future in it. So I started [Springboard's](https://www.springboard.com) Software Engineering Career Track last May, spurred on by an interest in software development born during my undergraduate studies.

Springboard directly led to the projects currently in my portfolio as of the time of this post, two of which were capstone projects that I had a great time working on. Now Springboard has directly led to the next step in my career, a contract as an Android Developer with [Rave Business Systems](https://www.ravebizz.com/).

I don't have any experience with mobile development as of now, and that's why Rave offers a 6-8 week intensive paid training program in Philadelphia, where I'll learn everything I need to know to get started as a junior app developer. My cohort will start the training program on March 29, and once the program is complete I'll start a two-year contract with one of Rave's clients: Chick-fil-A, Delta Airlines, State Farm, or one of many other fairly bigtime companies.

Besides the job itself and the prospect of getting my first couple of years' worth of development work under my belt, the biggest upside to this opportunity for me is to be able to branch out into another area of the software development field and broaden my skillset. Just about every business has a mobile app these days, and that's not likely to change any time soon. As far as the contract itself goes, it could be in a lot of different locations depending on the client, but with the current state of the world it's very likely to end up being remote work. That would be alright with me.
