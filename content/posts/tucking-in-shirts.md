This one is going to be unique.

I've never really written anything super personal on my blog before, and this one might well be more appropriate as a journal entry or something like that. As I start writing this, I'm not even sure if I'm going to publish it. But it'll be good to write whether I end up publishing it or not.

I want to tell you about a dream I had a few weeks ago. There was this girl I met during college; we'll call her Sarah. I went on a date with her once and nothing ever really came of it. There was no ill will involved or anything like that; we just never went out again. This was going on ten years ago at the time of writing and I haven't ever spoken to Sarah since. I remember finding out through Facebook awhile back that she got engaged, sometime before I quit Facebook.

Anyway, Sarah showed up in my dream a few weeks ago. I was at some Event, and she was there. I don't remember any of the details of this Event except that it was some kind of semi-formal thing and I was wearing slacks and a button-up shirt. Also my college roommate was there for some reason, and I had a date with Sarah planned for afterwards. I don't remember asking her out on a date in the dream; it was just one of those things in dreams that you just sort of know without knowing *how* you know or how it came about.

The Event was drawing to a close and there was a group of people standing around, including Sarah and my roommate. I said I had to go to the bathroom and I'd be right back to pick up Sarah and we'd go on our date. So I went to the bathroom and then started tucking my shirt back in. And kept tucking my shirt back in for an absurd amount of time. In fact, the rest of the dream was me tucking my shirt back in. I don't really know for how long I was doing that because of how dreams can screw with your perception of time, but it was definitely way longer than it ought to take to tuck in a shirt. I never got back to the group and I never went on the date with Sarah. I just tucked in my shirt for a while, and then I woke up.

Now I'm no Jungian psychologist and I don't know anything about dream analysis, and hoooo boy let me tell ya, I've had some far stranger dreams than this one. I don't know what the value of dreams is, what they're for, or why they happen, so it's quite possible that all of the thinking I've been doing about this lately is pointless. On the other hand, I can't deny that there's a recurring pattern that popped up in this one in particular which also happened to manifest itself in my real life around the same time. Coincidence? Probably, but if there's the smallest chance that my subconscious is trying to tell me something important, it might be a good idea to listen.

I've had a particular recurring dream for as long as I can remember, and it's the one I just described. That's not quite accurate; it's not the same dream that recurs, but the formula or the general layout. The pattern is this: there's something I have planned that I'm looking forward to (in this case the date), and there's some menial, fairly insignificant task or other small thing that gets in the way by taking far longer than it should (in this case the shirt tucking) and stops me from ever getting to the planned thing. The details are always different, but that's the pattern, and this one from a few weeks ago is the most recent example.

The probable symbolism seems pretty clear to me. If my subconscious is trying to tell me anything, it sounds like it's something about delay and avoidance. I wasn't tucking in my shirt for an hour because it was super important to have a perfectly tucked-in shirt; it was a way of avoiding something that might have been uncomfortable and even a little scary, but was also something I really wanted to do because it would have been more meaningful than any silly, menial task.

If we're assuming all this dream stuff actually means something and isn't just randomness, then it's probably also no coincidence that the most recent incarnation of this pattern came in the form of a silly task getting in the way of a date in particular. For all my [talk about family being the way to the Good Life](https://jasonmcginty.surge.sh/blog/and-he-was-expected/), the mechanics of how to actually make any of that happen remain the most frustratingly baffling problem in my life.

I often feel like I just missed that day of class or something and now everyone else seems to just know something I don't. To make matters worse, most of the time no one will even acknowledge that that day of class even happened at all, and asking anyone about it seems to bring puzzled dismissal at best, and outright shame at worst. There are a few people out there who acknowledge it and sometimes even try to teach others in my boat what they missed, but if you find ten of those people they'll tell you ten different things about what was taught that day, and at least eight of them will contradict each other. Some of them even sound like they probably missed that day too and they're just making stuff up to fool you.

Things pretty similar to this recurring dream pattern have shown up in my romantic life more than a few times over the years, namely having an attraction to someone and probably having a good chance of it being reciprocated, but just never saying anything or acting on it until it's too late. Sometimes there's a concrete shirt-tucking-in-type excuse for why I should wait *just a little longer* before acting and sometimes there's not, but the theme of avoidance is there either way. And yeah, it might have happened again just last week, which is what prompted me to write this. Last week being a couple of weeks *after* that most recent dream, interestingly enough. If I were a superstitious man, I might call that dream vaguely prophetic (I'm not superstitious though, just a little stitious).

So that's the story, I said to my mostly-imaginary audience. The obvious message of the recurring dream pattern is to stop being so avoidant and stop delaying about taking shots. You snooze, you lose, as it were. On the other hand maybe this is all nonsense, and *maybe* I'm even using the writing of this very article as a way of avoiding something else important. I don't know, man. Isn't it fun to publicly armchair-psychologize yourself?
